# jarvis

This is a small jarvis I made. To use it, Add the code to your venv, install packages, and use! It can chat with you, search things on google, open apps, run some
terminal commands. While the code is running, it has a hotward detector to detect the word jarvis. You can change this in the code. The project uses 2 levels of prompts - one to recognize what the command is. Second to respond to you if it is a chat command. Later on, I will add a DockerFile to it. I hope you enjoy!
